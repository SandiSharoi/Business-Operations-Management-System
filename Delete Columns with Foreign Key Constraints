-- Steps to Delete Columns with Foreign Key Constraints

-- 1. Identify Foreign Key Constraints: Run the following query to list the constraints on the position table:

SELECT conname, conrelid::regclass AS table_name, conkey, confrelid::regclass AS foreign_table
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid = 'position'::regclass AND contype = 'f';

-- 2. Drop Foreign Key Constraints: Once you identify the names of the constraints for team_id and department_id, drop them using:
ALTER TABLE position DROP CONSTRAINT <constraint_name>;

-- 3. Delete the Columns: After dropping the constraints, you can safely delete the columns:
ALTER TABLE position DROP COLUMN team_id;
ALTER TABLE position DROP COLUMN department_id;
